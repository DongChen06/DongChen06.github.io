We are looking for highly motivated research assistants (Ph.D., Master, and Undergraduates, Remote Interns) with aligned research interests. If you are interested in working with me, please send me an email (chendon9@msu.edu) with a copy of your CV and a summary of your qualifications.

## Mentoring Philosophy
I believe that students should enjoy the freedom that comes with academic research, allowing them to pursue great work while maintaining a healthy and fulfilling life. In my group, there are no strict working hoursâ€”students have the flexibility to manage their time as they want. Rather than focusing on rigid schedules or attendance tracking, I prioritize meaningful progress. Students are expected to deliver strong results in our weekly group meetings every Friday, after which they can fully enjoy their weekends. My goal is to create an environment that fosters both academic excellence and personal well-being.

I encourage students to participate in internships to gain exposure to career opportunities in national labs and industry. I actively work to build and extend my professional network to help connect students with valuable opportunities that align with their career goals.

International conferences provide excellent opportunities for students to build their professional network, gain exposure to cutting-edge research, and explore new places. I am committed to supporting my students in attending these events. For instance, in the first year of my career (2025), our team will participate in the IEEE ICRA conference in Atlanta and the ASABE conference in Toronto, Canada. I will work hard alongside my students to secure funding and provide as much support as possible to facilitate their participation in these valuable experiences.

If youâ€™d like to learn more about what life in my group is like, feel free to connect with my current or former studentsâ€”they'll be happy to share their experiences! ðŸ˜Š
