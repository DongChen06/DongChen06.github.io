## About me
Hello! I am a tenure-track assistant professor of Agricultural and Biological Engineering at Mississippi State University (MSU) starting in Fall 2024. Before coming to MSU, I served as a Postdoc Fellow at the University of Virginia (UVA), affiliated with both the [Environmental Institute](https://environment.virginia.edu/) and [Link Lab](https://engineering.virginia.edu/link-lab) mentored by Drs. [Arsalan Heydarian](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/arsalan-heydarian) and [Brad Campbell](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/brad-campbell). I earned my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Michigan State University in 2023, guided by Dr. [Zhaojian Li](https://www.egr.msu.edu/rival/). Before that, I obtained my B.Eng. degree from the Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in June 2017.

**Research Interests**: My research focuses on advancing AI-driven agricultural systems by integrating machine learning, robotics, and domain knowledge to enable efficient, adaptable, and intelligent decision-making in real-world farming environments.

      Delicate fruits such as strawberries are highly susceptible to bruising and damage during conventional harvesting.
      This project aims to develop soft robotic systems with compliant end-effectors, integrated sensing, and AI-based 
      control strategies to enable gentle, selective, and efficient harvesting of fragile fruits in dynamic field environments.
